# Task-and-Motion-Re-Planning-for-Multi-Agent-Systems

## Description

The entire work mainly contains two parts: *Motion Re-Planning* and *Makespan Prediction*. It is mainly about *Motion Re-Planning* in this repository. There is another related repository to this work: [tapas-learner](https://github.com/Wenkai-Xuan/tapas-learner.git), which demonstrates the *Makespan Prediction* part.

*Motion Re-Planning* describes the situation

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context, like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

This work is mainly built using *Python*. I recommend you to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) as the virtual environment.

To make it possible for you to view the simulation, you have to install mujoco==3.2.3 and glfw==2.7.0.

Or instead, you can directly install all packages as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:Wenkai-Xuan/Task-and-Motion-Re-Planning-for-Multi-Agent-Systems.git
cd Task-and-Motion-Re-Planning-for-Multi-Agent-Systems
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All of these packages are compatible with *Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS*. 

## About data files

The data files in the folder 'mujoco_simulation/unified_scene/replans/replan_data' are generated by the python files 'read2sim_datagen.py' and 'read2show_datagen.py'. The difference between these two python files are: 'read2show_datagen.py' generates the 'drop-caused new initial configurations' with showing the views of the scenes in MuJoCo, while 'read2sim_datagen.py' only does simulation without visualization.

Since the data files are too large to upload. There are only the trained models in each folder under 'mujoco_simulation/unified_scene/replans/replan_data'. The exact data for training and testing the network should be generated by the user.


## Visuals
Here is a GIF showing the whole process of motion re-planning.

More videos of such re-planning process are listed [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoTeV4reqxJkiIM6ZK_HAVYujVkRW5In0).

## Roadmap
In future work, it may be possible to put this work into real-world configurations.

## Documentations
As the simulation environment is MuJoCo, take a careful look at the [MuJoCo Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/). Here is also [another documentation](https://shimo.im/docs/Ee32m6dOwRi2K1A2) for the building process of this work; however, this documentation is private, please send me a request if you need it. The PDF file report also explains clearly everything about this work.
