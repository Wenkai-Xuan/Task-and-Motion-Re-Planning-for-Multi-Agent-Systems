# Task-and-Motion-Re-Planning-for-Multi-Agent-Systems

## Description

The entire work mainly contains two parts: *Motion Re-Planning* and *Makespan Prediction*. It is mainly about *Motion Re-Planning* in this repository. There is another related repository to this work: [tapas-learner](https://github.com/Wenkai-Xuan/tapas-learner.git), which demonstrates the *Makespan Prediction* part.

*Motion Re-Planning* describes the situation

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context, like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

This work is mainly built using *Python*. I recommend you to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) as the virtual environment.

To make it possible for you to view the simulation, you have to install mujoco==3.2.3 and glfw==2.7.0.

Or instead, you can directly install all packages as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:Wenkai-Xuan/Task-and-Motion-Re-Planning-for-Multi-Agent-Systems.git
cd Task-and-Motion-Re-Planning-for-Multi-Agent-Systems
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All of these packages are compatible with *Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS*. 

## About data files

The data files in the folder 'mujoco_simulation/unified_scene/replans/replan_data' are generated by the python files 'read2sim_datagen.py' and 'read2show_datagen.py'. The difference between these two python files are: 'read2show_datagen.py' generates the 'drop-caused new initial configurations' with showing the views of the scenes in MuJoCo, while 'read2sim_datagen.py' only does simulation without visualization.

Since the data files are too large to upload. There are only the trained models in each folder under 'mujoco_simulation/unified_scene/replans/replan_data'. The exact data for training and testing the network should be generated by the user.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.


## Visuals

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.


## Roadmap
In future work, it may be possible to put this work into real-world configurations.

## Documentations
As the simulation environment is MuJoCo, take a careful look at the [MuJoCo Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/). Here is also [another documentation](https://shimo.im/docs/Ee32m6dOwRi2K1A2) for the building process of this work; however, this documentation is private, please send me a request if you need it. The PDF file report also explains clearly everything about this work.
